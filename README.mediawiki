= Zero-Configuration for Android =

This repository is populated by RoS packages for handling zero-configuration on android.
For this it is using jmdns. You will need the zeroconf_implementations stack.

Note that this is maintained as a separate stack because it cannot be installed and 
compiled via rosdeps as the other packages are (needs the android sdk manually installed).
